Updated README.md for PMLL_Blockchain_Assembly
PMLL Blockchain Assembly
The PMLL Blockchain Assembly project represents a comprehensive effort to translate and modularize key concepts of programming, particularly the C programming language, into Assembly Language. This library serves as a foundation for runtime environments, memory management, I/O operations, boolean logic, and more. The project defines and formalizes the granular logic of the Persistent Memory Logic Loop (PMLL) and the associated modular systems.

Overview
This project provides assembly-level implementations of fundamental programming constructs and runtime environment components. It lays out the building blocks for creating a C runtime, from I/O operations to dynamic memory management, control structures, and graphical rendering.

Core Features
Persistent Memory Logic Loop (PMLL):

Implements infinite loops (while (1)) with counter-based logic (for) in assembly.
Facilitates modular design and extensibility.
Memory Management:

malloc.s and free.s: Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
memory.s: Comprehensive memory management, including read/write capabilities.
Control Structures:

while.s, for.s, if-else.s: Implements control flow in assembly.
loop.s: Core logic loop handling.
Boolean Logic:

and.s, or.s, not.s, xor.s: Full boolean operation suite.
bool.s: Encapsulation of boolean states using 1.s and 0.s.
I/O Operations:

write.s, read.s: Low-level I/O primitives.
printf.s: Formatted output functionality.
Graphical and Text Rendering:

screen.s, window.s, pixel.s: Defines screen and pixel-level operations.
ASCII.s, string.s: Encodes and renders text and strings.
Environment Management:

test_enviroment.s: Creates a sandbox environment for debugging.
enviroment.s: Production-level environment setup.
Library Integration:

C.s: The backbone runtime for integrating all modules into a coherent C runtime.

Usage
Example: PMLL Loop
The Persistent Memory Logic Loop (PMLL) is implemented in pmll.s:

asm
Copy code
.section .data
JKE_counter: .long 0
MAX_COUNT: .long 50

.section .text
.global PMLL_loop

PMLL_loop:
    movl JKE_counter(%rip), %eax
    cmpl MAX_COUNT(%rip), %eax
    jge LOOP_END
    call process_logic
    incl %eax
    movl %eax, JKE_counter(%rip)
    jmp PMLL_loop

LOOP_END:
    ret
Example: Memory Allocation
Using malloc.s and memory.s:

asm
Copy code
movq $64, %rdi  # Allocate 64 bytes
call malloc_memory
call deallocate_memory
Example: Screen and Graphics
Using screen.s and pixel.s:

asm
Copy code
call initialize_screen
call draw_pixel
call refresh_screen
