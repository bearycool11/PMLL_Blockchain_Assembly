MOV AX, 0x.s    ; Load superposition state (potential existence)
CMP AX, 0x.s    ; Check if it remains in potential
JZ HALT         ; If still in potential, do not compute
MOV AX, 0x1A1.s ; Collapse into first AI-defined state (actual computation)
MOV BX, AX      ; BX inherits AI's first computational definition
